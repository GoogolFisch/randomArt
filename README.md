## Info
```
file=filename.png -(fl) to where the generated file should be stored
stack=10          -(st) how deep the nested expressions should get
scale=400         -(sz) how big the scale should be
seed=???          - set a seed to controll the generator
tree=?            - if an tree file should be used
size=..x..        - the output size of the image
--jit             - to enable jit compiler
--simpl           - remove bad paths
--with-feat       - regenerate the tree if it is boring
--with-color      - regenerate the tree if it doesn't have color
--with-depth      - regenerate the tree if it doesn't have color
--with-all        - regenerate the tree with every feature
-v                - show extra information
```

## May be doing
There might come more diffrences between interpreting and compiling.

Features 4 the jit to come:
- and maybe adding more operations
