## TODO
Currently the diffrence between interpreting and compiling is existant!
I'll have to change that in the future!

Features 4 the jit to come:
- parity between jit and interpreter
- cross product
- and maybe adding more operations

Other Features to come:
- you being albe to input custom instruction trees
  - like copy paste of the output tree
- range feature for possible raw-float values
  - idea: float=-2..2 or -2:2
- ranges for the display, not only an square
  - idea: output=1600x900 or 1600:900
- better random tree generator, so less boring happens
  (When Cross Product of Scalar and Scalar happens = 0)
